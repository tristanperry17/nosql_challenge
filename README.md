# nosql_challenge

This project contains two notebooks, a setup and an analysis notebook. The resource file, "establishments.json" is loaded into MongoDB. The setup notebook ensures the data is loaded, modifies data types, adds a new entry, and deletes uwanted entries. The analysis notebook runs queries on the database to pull relevant information.
